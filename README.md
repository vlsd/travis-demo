# travis-demo

During this interactive session, we will (i) create a python package, (ii)
write a few simple unit tests, and (iii) automate testing with [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/). Clone this repo and come prepared to write a v
crappy python package, some simple unit tests, and to see how automated testing
can help you catch bugs before they become an unexpectedly big issue.

To keep this focused on automated testing, this little demo will not cover
posting the resulting python package on pypi.
